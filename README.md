Implementation of different injection methods. Will be released in several steps over a long time.

Added:
[+] ShellCode Injection
[+] DLL Injection

Also added is a little helper function which should identify the process, which should be used for the injection, and this function returns the ProcessID. This was added for a better overview, if you decide to visualize this detailled workflow with tools like procDOT.

Slides and more detailled information will be added in the future. At this moment, this is a private project next to work and famliy, so I hope you can apologize the not continuous upload.

If there are any comments please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your support!
